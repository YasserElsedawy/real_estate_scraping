# real_estate_scraping
How Covid-19 will impact the real estate market in Italy is hard to predict. The real estate industry is being striked by the coronavirus, and itâ€™s going to get worse before it gets better. The effects on real estate will vary by sector and market, and the extent of the effects will depend upon the duration of the economic shutdown.

The sectors of real estate that have been hit hardest so far are hotels, restaurants, bars and other entertainment distinations followed closely by retail and housing.

In this project we will be investigating the trend of housing renting prices in Milan, Italy, before and after the coronavirus outbreak, in particular before and after Feb 21st. 

We will be scrapping the data from kijiji.it for all the available renint apartments in the city. This website is an online advertising service that operates as a centralized network of online communities, organized by city and urban region, for posting local advertisements. It is a fully owned subsidiary of eBay launched in February 2005.
