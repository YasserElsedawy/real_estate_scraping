# real_estate_scraping

How COVID-19 will impact the real estate market in Italy is hard to predict. The real estate industry is being hit by the coronavirus, and itâ€™s going to get worse before it gets better. The effects on real estate will vary by sector and market, and the extent of the effects will depend upon the duration of the economic shutdown.

The sectors of real estate that have been hit hardest so far are hotels, restaurants, bars and other entertainment destinations followed closely by retail and housing.

In this project we will be investigating the trend of residential real estate sector in Milan, Italy, before and after the coronavirus outbreak, in particular before and after Feb 21st. The residential sector focuses on the buying, selling and rental of properties used as homes or for non-professional purposes. The residential real estate sector is comprised of single-family homes, apartments, condominiums, planned unit developments, and more.

We will be scrapping the data from kijiji.it for all the available renting apartments offerings or postings on the platform from January 1st until April 15th. kijiji is an online advertising service fully owned subsidiary of eBay launched in February 2005. Kijiji websites are available for more than 100 cities in Canada and Italy.
